## Getting Started

To get started with UnikStore, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IgorCastromann/unikStore
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd unikstore
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

   4.a) To local development, it was used JSON server, to start it run in a new terminal:

   ```bash
   yarn server
   ```

   NOTE: depending on the ip of your emulator, you might have to change `package json` `server` with `--host ip-goes-here server/db.json` to match the emulator.
   example: mine is `"server": "npx json-server --host 192.168.15.12 server/db.json"`

   4.b) you can also use the mockApi creating a .env

4. create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

   ```bash
   // .env

   // mockApi link

   # EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://6413209fa68505ea732a0fc8.mockapi.io/api/v1/

   // json server
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.15.12:3000
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FRAMES_REACT_NATIVE_KEY=pk_test_4296fd52-efba-4a38-b6ce-cf0d93639d8a

   ```

   NOTE: you can choose only one `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`

   ```

   ```

5. Start the Expo app:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

6. Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code to view the app or if you have an open emulator, just type `a` to open android.

7. You can also build with xCode or android studio, just run the following comand to create `android` and `ios` folders:
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   ```

# Architecture inside folders

## Controller Architecture

The Controller Architecture is a structured approach to organizing frontend applications, separating UI components from logic to enhance modularity and maintainability.

## Key Components:

#### UI Components:

Responsible for rendering the user interface and receiving data and actions from controllers. UI components remain focused on presentation.

#### Controllers:

Manage state, data fetching, and business logic. They handle user interactions, data manipulation, and orchestrate information flow within the application.

#### Nested Controllers:

Controllers may be nested to encapsulate related functionality or handle specific UI parts, promoting better organization and modularity.

## Benefits:

#### Separation of Concerns:

Cleanly separates UI logic from business logic, improving code maintainability and testability.

#### Modularity:

Encapsulates functionality into reusable modules, facilitating feature addition, modification, and removal without disrupting other parts.

#### Scalability:

Scales well with application growth, enabling the addition of new controllers to manage expanding features or sections of the UI.
